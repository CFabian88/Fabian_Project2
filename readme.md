Description:
The purpose of this project is to showcase an array of skills in data analysis of stock price data. My goal is to teach individuals how to analyze a stock's price and to be able to determine what forms of statistical models are appropriate, especially integrated moving averages.

For my Streamlit dashboard, I made a tutorial on how one can use stock data to determine if autoregressive integrate moving averages are a useful predictor of future price movements. In doing so, the leader learns a variety of advanced techniques to explore the characteristics of price data like: skewness, kurtosis, rolling standard deviation, parial autocorrelation functions and more.

For my Deepnote project, I created a neural network from scratch that intakes stock price data and outputs prediciton values for the future that can be cross-validated. I also show the user how to measure the effectiveness of their model using root mean squared error and tips on how to improve the model. Lastly, I show the user how to save the model as a .h5 file that can be called to othe python scripts and used to predict future stock prices.
